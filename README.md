# Car-Price-Prediction-using-RandomForest

In this project, we use Random Forest to predict the price of car with various input parameter.

Procedure:
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.
=> Collect dataset of car with price and parameters.
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.
=> Segregate the independant and dependant values.
=> Convert the categorical and text data to numerical format.
=> Scale independent variables.
=> Splitting dataset to test and train.
=> Use  Random Forest algorithm.
=> Visualise graph.
=> Prediction and validation.
